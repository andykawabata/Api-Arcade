# Api-Arcade  

Project for CSC-340 Software Engineering  
Team: The Elon Musketeers

### General Info  
This Java desktop application is an 'arcade' of trivia-based mini games, all dependent on external API's to extract the questions. Once a user creates an account, their game scores will be saved to the database. There is a leaderboard page that displays the three highest scores for each game. The app's "Generic Game" architecture allows developers to quickly and easily add new games, so you will never get bored!
